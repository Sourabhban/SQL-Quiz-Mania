# SQL Quiz App

This is a fully interactive **SQL MCQ Quiz App** that I built using
**HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal of this project is to help
learners practice and test their knowledge of SQL/MySQL through a clean
and responsive quiz interface.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üåü Features

-   **Large Question Bank**: 300+ multiple-choice questions covering SQL
    fundamentals, queries, constraints, functions, and advanced
    concepts.\
-   **Interactive UI**: Smooth navigation with **Next/Previous**
    buttons, live **score display**, and a **progress bar** that fills
    as you advance.\
-   **Answer Feedback**: Each question shows whether your choice was
    correct/incorrect, along with a short explanation.\
-   **Responsive Design**: Styled with CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly
    layout. Works well on desktops, tablets, and phones.\
-   **Final Report**: At the end of the quiz, your total score is
    displayed with a performance message and a restart option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **HTML5**: Structure and quiz layout (`index.html`).\
-   **CSS3**: Styling with gradients, animations, and responsiveness
    (`style.css`).\
-   **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core quiz logic, question rendering,
    navigation, scoring, and explanations (`main.js`).\
-   **Font Awesome**: Icons for a polished look.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üöÄ How It Works

1.  Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2.  Start the quiz --- questions load dynamically from `main.js`.
3.  Click on an answer; the app highlights correct/incorrect responses.
4.  Move through questions using navigation buttons.
5.  At the end, view your score and restart the quiz if you want another
    round.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## üéØ Purpose

I built this project as a fun way to revise SQL concepts and strengthen
database skills. It's also a good beginner-friendly project to practice
**JavaScript DOM manipulation** and **responsive web design**.
